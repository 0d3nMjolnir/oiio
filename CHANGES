Changes:


Release 0.5.2 (TBD)
-------------------

* maketx: in the case where the input texture was already float and needed
  no pow2 rounding, we didn't get the tiling or other metadata right.

  

Release 0.5 (31 May 2009)
-------------------------

Features:

* New image format plugins: zfile (r529), ICO (r579,585,588,619,637),
  BMP (reads only) (r580,584,614,625)

* ImageCache and TextureSystem: better stats (r528, r717), bug fixes for
  large untiled images (r558,561), anisotropic improvements, stats
  improvements, thread safety improvements (r566),
  invalidate/invalidate_all (r591), better error reporting (r606),
  thread safety fixes (r650), fix problem when filter size was precisely
  at a mipmap level it blurred to higher level (r687), avoid problems
  when blur > 1 and there is no 1x1 mip level (r687).
* maketx: --shadow (r530), --nomipmap (r531), big speedups (r699).
* idiff: add RMS error and PSNR (r622).

Fixes and minor enhancements:

* iinfo: fix - lack of help message when no files specified (r513).

  packets (r674).

* iv: more robust to certain OpenGL versions (r550), support for OpenGL
  versions that don't support non-pow2 textures (r563), correct texture
  mapping when GL_NV_texture_rectangle is the best texture mapping
  extension we can find (r572).
* idiff: refactored to use ImageBuf internally (r541)

For developers:

* Switch to CMake for builds.
* Build enhancements: 'make USE_OPENGL=0' (r512), better handling of
  certain system OpenGL headers (r512), more robust with Qt location
  (r542), handle older Boost 1.35 (r574).
* Tests: test_libOpenImageIO (r581), ico (r621),

  attribute/getattribute (r321), accept non-tiled and non-mipped

  origin is not (0,0) (r291), fix leak of exr writer (r292), conform to
  common conventions for camera matrix naming (r367), regularize
  capitalization of metadata (r412)
* TIFF plugin: bug fix for combination of tile + separate (r304), fixes
  to retrieval of matrix tags (r366)
* HDR plugin: emulate random access of scanlines (r387), better error
  reporting (r451).
